Editors must manually analyze scripts, search video clips, match dialogues, adjust pacing, and maintain emotional consistency, which significantly slows down content creation.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe objective of this project is to design an AI-powered automated film editor that accepts a screenplay and raw video clips, understands narrative context, emotional tone, dialogue, and visual atmosphere, and autonomously generates a coherent, emotionally aligned edited video.\n\nReal-World Relevance & Motivation\n\nThis system is highly relevant for content creators, filmmakers, advertisers, and social-media editors who need fast, consistent, and intelligent video editing. It reduces production time, lowers skill barriers, and enables scalable creative automation.",

Data Understanding & Preparation\n\nDataset Source\nThe project uses user-uploaded raw video clips and screenplay text.\nData is collected directly from users rather than public datasets.\n\nData Loading & Exploration\n\nScreenplay text is loaded as raw text input.\nVideo clips are loaded using video processing libraries.\nAudio tracks are extracted from video files for speech analysis.\nVisual frames are sampled for atmosphere and color analysis.\nCleaning, Preprocessing & Feature Engineering\nScreenplay text is vectorized using TF-IDF for semantic comparison.\nAudio is converted to text using speech recognition APIs.\nVideo frames are analyzed for brightness, color temperature, and contrast.\nMetadata tags such as Bright, Dark, Warm, Cool are generated.\n\nHandling Noise & Missing Data\n\nIf dialogue is unclear or missing, visual and contextual similarity is prioritized.\nConfidence scores indicate uncertainty when perfect matches are unavailable.",
